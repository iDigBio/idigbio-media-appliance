iDigBio Media Appliance v2

The iDigBio Media Appliance is a cross-platform local web app that is used to upload media files from a local computer environment into iDigBio storage where they become available on the public Internet.

The iDigBio Media Appliance was formerly known as the iDigBio Ingestion Tool or Image upload tool.

This new iDigBio Media Appliance has been generalized to handle additional media types and is not limited to images.

Supported browsers include recent Firefox and Chrome.  The use of Internet Explorer is strongly discouraged due to a number of known compatibility issues.

Supported operating systems include 64-bit Linux, OS X, and Windows.

Python 3.5 is *required* for OSX installs. Python 3.5 is recommended (Anaconda install packaging is provided in the releases) for all platforms, but python 2.7 should work on linux and windows platforms.
